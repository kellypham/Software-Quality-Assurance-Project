# Auction-Style Sales Service

The system consists of two parts:

- the Front End, a point of purchase terminal for bidding and advertising items (written in C++)
[Front End] (FrontEnd/README.md)

- the Back End, an overnight batch processor to maintain and update a master auctions file (written in Java)

Both parts will be run as console applications, that is, they are to be invoked from a command line and use text and text file input/output only.
